<Info>
    LDAP is a paid feature.

   If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
   then you should contact sales@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members authenticate with the platform via [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)

To note, configuring LDAP retains the end-to-end encrypted architecture of Infisical because we decouple the authentication and decryption steps; the LDAP server cannot and will not have access to the decryption key needed to decrypt your secrets.

LDAP providers:

- Active Directory
- [JumpCloud LDAP](/documentation/platform/ldap/jumpcloud)
- AWS Directory Service
- Foxpass

Check out the general instructions for configuring LDAP [here](/documentation/platform/ldap/general).
