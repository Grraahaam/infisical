## Starting Infisical for development

We use Docker to spin up all required services for Infisical in local development. If you are unfamiliar with Docker, donâ€™t worry, all you have to do is install Docker for your
machine and run the command below to start up the development server.

### Requirements

You need to have at least the below tools installed on your machine

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Start local server

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build --force-recreate
````

### Access local server

Once all the services have spun up, browse to http://localhost:8080. To sign in, you'll have to create the admin user when prompted.

### Shutdown local server

```sh
# To stop environment use Control+C (on Mac) CTRL+C (on Win) or
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```
